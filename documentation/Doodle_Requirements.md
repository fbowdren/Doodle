**Doodle Requirements**

**Outline Of System**
* The customer needs an on-line system to enter details for the latest Doodle branch.

* The on-line system must take details of their requirements to ensure that all needs of the branch are listed for a building contractor. For example, they may wish to have a 538,000 square feet building for the data center or it may need to be held underwater.

* The requirements gathering system should be clean and simple.

* The system needs to take into account the usual details about dimensions and cost/budget.

* It must be possible to upload files or images which may be sample construction diagrams. Jpgs are fine. Do not worry about autocad, etc.

**Users**

* Two types of user, normal & administrator.

* A normal user can enter details but cannot edit details.

* An Administrator user can access detailed information & edit existing information.

* The customer can create a normal user via the front page.

* Account creation will need a valid id and email address before access is granted.

* An Administrator user can only be created during system setup or by another Administrator user.

* The user will need to enter their username and password to log in.

* If the username and password are correct they shall gain access to the on-line system.

* If the username and/or password are incorrect then the user will remain on the home page and an error message will be displayed.

* After logging out the user will return to the home page.

* Upon clicking the Submit button the user will be presented with a summary of the details entered and given the chance to submit or update.

* If Submit is chosen, the details are uploaded, and the customer is returned to the home page.

* If Update is chosen, the user will remain in the current page and can update fields before submitting again.
